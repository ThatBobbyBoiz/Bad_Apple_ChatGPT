Overview

Bad Apple on ChatGPT is a project that allows you to display the popular Bad Apple video as an ASCII art animation on the ChatGPT platform. The project includes Python and JavaScript code that you can use to generate the ASCII art and display it on ChatGPT.
Setup and Installation

To use Bad Apple on ChatGPT, you'll need to complete the following steps:

    Download the Bad Apple video and extract it into individual frames (approximately 6571 frames). You can use any available video-to-image conversion tool to extract the frames. We recommend using the videotoframes Python package.
    Run the create_ascii_art.py Python script to convert the Bad Apple frames into ASCII art and save them in a specified directory.
    Upload your ASCII art files to your personal GitHub repository and make the repository public.

Usage

Once you've completed the setup and installation process, you can display the Bad Apple ASCII art animation on ChatGPT by following these steps:

    Log in to your ChatGPT account.
    Create a new chat or use an existing one.
    Enable the web developer tools by pressing the F12 key.
    In the developer tools, go to the Inspector tab and search for the textarea element that contains the chat message box.
    Edit the HTML code of the textarea element to increase the height and change the font size, line height, and font family.
    In the Console tab, paste the contents of the run_bad_apple_chatgpt.js JavaScript file and run the script.

The Bad Apple animation will be displayed in the chat message box. Please note that it may take some time for the ASCII art to load, depending on the speed of your internet connection and the size of your ASCII art files.
